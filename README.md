# CLI

A templated repository for a CLI written in Go.

What you get by using this repo template:

* GitHub Workflows for Build and Release
* Docker distribution via GitHub Packages
  - Release images are labled using opencontainers annotations
  - Two versions are pushed automatically: `latest` and explicit tag version
* Goreleaser configuration defaults for cross-platform builds
  - This does _not_ include signing (refer to [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/sign/) for docs)
* A placeholder CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* A placeholder Apache 2.0 license
* Project initialization according to the owner/repository where initialized
